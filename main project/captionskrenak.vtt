00:02.669 --> 00:04.696
[[media-item-1]]
I hope not to offend

00:05.841 --> 00:07.560
[[media-item-5]]
with my demonstration

00:08.669 --> 00:10.860
[[media-item-6]]
the protocol of this House.

00:15.613 --> 00:17.206
[[media-item-2]]
But I believe that

00:23.662 --> 00:25.603
[[media-item-7]]
you cannot remain

00:29.039 --> 00:30.189
[[media-item-8]]
omissive,

00:31.100 --> 00:33.430
[[media-item-3]]
you will not be able to remain

00:33.430 --> 00:35.063
oblivious

00:35.285 --> 00:37.140
to this aggression,

00:37.743 --> 00:42.000
moved by economic power,
by greed,

00:46.632 --> 00:49.728
by ignorance of what it means to be indigenous.

00:53.337 --> 00:54.548
Indigenous people

00:56.149 --> 00:57.597
have a way of thinking,

01:00.000 --> 01:01.820
have a way of living,

01:07.861 --> 01:10.479
have fundamental conditions for their existence,

01:10.479 --> 01:12.372
and for the manifestation of their tradition,

01:12.372 --> 01:14.270
of their life, of their culture

01:14.270 --> 01:16.826
that do not endanger, and have never endangered

01:16.826 --> 01:22.191
the existence of the animals that live around indigenous areas

01:22.191 --> 01:24.706
let alone other human beings.

01:25.408 --> 01:28.502
I believe that none of you can ever point to

01:28.502 --> 01:33.186
acts, attitudes of the indigenous people of Brazil

01:33.186 --> 01:36.536
that have put at risk either the life

01:36.536 --> 01:40.250
or the property of any person,

01:40.250 --> 01:45.170
of any human group in this country.

01:45.170 --> 01:48.000
And today we are the target of an aggression

01:49.457 --> 01:51.755
that intends to strike

01:51.755 --> 01:55.286
in essence
our faith,

01:55.828 --> 02:00.498
our confidence that dignity still exists,

02:03.437 --> 02:06.999
that it is still possible to build a society

02:06.999 --> 02:10.233
that knows how to respect the weakest;

02:10.676 --> 02:12.134
that knows how to respect those

02:12.134 --> 02:14.211
who do not have the money to maintain a campaign

02:14.211 --> 02:16.211
of incessant defamation.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.293
That knows how to respect

02:19.293 --> 02:21.616
the people who have always lived

02:21.616 --> 02:24.310
in the absence of all wealth.

02:24.803 --> 02:28.299
People who live in houses covered with straw,

02:28.299 --> 02:30.400
who sleep on mats on the ground

02:30.400 --> 02:32.920
must not be identified in any way

02:32.920 --> 02:36.290
as the people who are the enemy of Brazil's interests,

02:36.290 --> 02:38.558
the enemy of the interests of the nation,

02:38.558 --> 02:41.027
and who jeopardise any development.

02:42.678 --> 02:44.471
The indigenous people

02:44.471 --> 02:47.890
have watered with blood every hectare

02:47.890 --> 02:50.338
of Brazil's 8 million square kilometres,

02:50.338 --> 02:52.565
you are witnesses of this.

02:54.856 --> 02:56.493
I'd like to thank

02:58.266 --> 03:00.064
the President of this House,

03:00.877 --> 03:02.347
I thank you all,

03:02.950 --> 03:04.448
and I hope my words have not

03:06.431 --> 03:07.909
offended

03:08.771 --> 03:14.091
the feelings of the gentlemen in this House.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.986
Defense of the Popular Constitutional Amendment dealing with the rights of Indigenous people in Brazil

03:18.986 --> 03:20.986
Plenary of the House of Representatives in BrasÃ­lia

03:20.986 --> 03:22.986
September 4, 1987

03:25.314 --> 03:26.526
Thank you.
