1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,696
I hope not to offend

2
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:07,560
with my demonstration

3
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:10,860
the protocol of this House.

4
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,206
But I believe that

5
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:25,603
you cannot remain

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,189
omissive,

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,430
you will not be able to remain

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,063
oblivious

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,140
to this aggression,

10
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:42,000
moved by economic power,
by greed,

11
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:49,728
by ignorance of what it means to be indigenous.

12
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:54,548
Indigenous people

13
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:57,597
have a way of thinking,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,820
have a way of living,

15
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:10,479
have fundamental conditions for their existence,

16
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,372
and for the manifestation of their tradition,

17
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,270
of their life, of their culture

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,826
that do not endanger, and have never endangered

19
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:22,191
the existence of the animals that live around indigenous areas

20
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:24,706
let alone other human beings.

21
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:28,502
I believe that none of you can ever point to 

22
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:33,186
acts, attitudes of the indigenous people of Brazil

23
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:36,536
that have put at risk either the life 

24
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:40,250
or the property of any person,

25
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,170
of any human group in this country.

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,000
And today we are the target of an aggression

27
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:51,755
that intends to strike

28
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:55,286
in essence
our faith,

29
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,498
our confidence that dignity still exists,

30
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:06,999
that it is still possible to build a society

31
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,233
that knows how to respect the weakest;

32
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:12,134
that knows how to respect those

33
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:14,211
who do not have the money to maintain a campaign

34
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,211
of incessant defamation.

35
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,293
That knows how to respect

36
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,616
the people who have always lived

37
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:24,310
in the absence of all wealth.

38
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:28,299
People who live in houses covered with straw,

39
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:30,400
who sleep on mats on the ground

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,920
must not be identified in any way

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,290
as the people who are the enemy of Brazil's interests,

42
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,558
the enemy of the interests of the nation,

43
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,027
and who jeopardise any development.

44
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:44,471
The indigenous people

45
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:47,890
have watered with blood every hectare

46
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,338
of Brazil's 8 million square kilometres,

47
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,565
you are witnesses of this.

48
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,493
I'd like to thank 

49
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,064
the President of this House,

50
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:02,347
I thank you all,

51
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,448
and I hope my words have not

52
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,909
offended

53
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:14,091
 the feelings of the gentlemen in this House.

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,986
Defense of the Popular Constitutional Amendment dealing with the rights of Indigenous people in Brazil

55
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:20,986
Plenary of the House of Representatives in BrasÃ­lia

56
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,986
September 4, 1987

57
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:26,526
Thank you.
