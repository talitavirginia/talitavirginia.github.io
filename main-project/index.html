	<div data-time="0" data-name="nurdle" class="box">
		<p>NURDLE n. (1990s)<br />
		a very small pellet of plastic which serves as raw material in the manufacture of plastic products; also known as a “pre-production pellet” or “primary microplastic".</p>
	</div>
	
	<div data-time="0" data-name="plastitrash" class="box">
		<p>PLASTITRASH n. (2000)<br />
		garbage, litter, debris or other waste material made of any type of plastic material</p>
	</div>
	
	<div data-time="0" data-name="plastic_confetti" class="box">
		<p>PLASTIC CONFETTI n. (2011)<br />
		small, “multi-colored fragments” of plastic formed by the degradation of larger plastic pollution. The earliest found use in this context described plastic present in the surface waters and beaches of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
	</div>	

	<div data-time="0" data-name="microplastic" class="box">
		<p>MICROPLASTIC n. (2004)<br />
		fragments of any type of plastic less than 5 mm in length.</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="pyroplastic" class="box">
		<p>PYROPLASTIC n. (2019)<br />
		geogenic masses of melted plastic debris found in beach environments. Similar in appearance to plastiglomerates, they are distinguished by encapsulation of plastic without agglomeration of extraneous material, leading to low bulk density and subsequent floating in seawater</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="plasticrust" class="box">
		<p>PLASTICRUST n. (2019)<br />
		plastic debris attached to tropical or subtropical rocky intertidal shores; crusts are variable in size, color, and thickness. This is a more focused term for “in situ plastiglomerate,” which they defined as “molten plastic … adhered to the surface of a basalt flow.”</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="plastiglomerate" class="box">
		<p>PLASTIGLOMERATE n. (2014)<br />
		“an indurated, multi-composite material made hard by agglutination of rock and molten plastic... an in situ type, in which plastic is adhered to rock outcrops, and a clastic type, in which combinations of basalt, coral, shells, and local woody debris are cemented with grains of sand in a plastic matrix," both types interpreted to result from campfire burning.</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="plastivore" class="box">
		<p>PLASTIVORE n. (2011)<br />
		any organism that ingests, processes, and regurgitates or defecates plastic materials. “The Laysan albatross is probably the most voracious plastivore on the planet”.</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="epiplastic" class="box">
		<p>EPIPLASTIC adj. (2014)<br />
		living on floating plastic; used earlier to refer to periphyton colonization of plastic surfaces in experimental mesocosms.</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="plastisphere" class="box">
		<p>PLASTISPHERE n. (2013)<br />
		the living microbiotic and macrobiotic community colonizing plastic.</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="plasticized" class="box">
		<p>PLASTICIZED adj. (2014)<br />
		made abstractly plastic by the proliferation of plastic pollution in the environment. This stems from plasticize (v.): “to make plastic or mouldable, especially by the addition of a plasticizer”.</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="plasticene" class="box">
		<p>PLASTICENE n. & adj. (2011)<br />
		an era in Earth's history, within the Anthropocene, commencing in the 1950s, marked stratigraphically in the depositional record by a new and increasing layer of plastic. The history and etymology of plasticene in this sense is not related to the word plasticene, a common early spelling of the popular molding clay, plasticine.</p>
	</div>

	<div data-time="0" data-name="plastic_cycle" class="box">
		<p>PLASTIC CYCLE n. (2019)<br />
		“the continuous and complex movement of plastic materials between different abiotic and biotic ecosystem compartments, including human”. Here, “cycle” is not only the movement of plastics, but also their origin (production and sources), evolution (changes of properties), interactions, impacts, and sinks in the environment.</p>
