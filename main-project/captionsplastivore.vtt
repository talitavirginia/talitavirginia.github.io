Plastivore for instance,

00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:03.337
[[media-item-2]]
that to me is a word

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:05.381
[[media-item-3]]
that really captures

00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:08.509
[[media-item-4]]
a lot of the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.885
[[media-item-5]]
sinister nature of

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:12.802
[[media-item-6]]
some of the impacts

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:16.198
[[media-item-7]]

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:18.160

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.938
[[media-item-9]]
it's less impactful to talk about

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:25.280
[[media-item-10]]
the ingestion of plastics, right?
